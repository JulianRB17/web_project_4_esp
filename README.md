# Project 4: Around The U.S.

### Overview

* Figma
* Images

**Figma**

* [Link to the project in Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/LDMgqWesKpQkIwhOfEBuTS/WEB%2C-Sprint-5%3A-Around-The-U.S.-%7C-desktop-%2B-mobile?node-id=0%3A1)

**Images**

The way you'll do this at work is by exporting images directly from Figma â€” we recommend doing that to practice more. Don't forget to optimize them [here](https://tinypng.com/), so your project loads faster.
